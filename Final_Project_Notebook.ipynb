    "\n",
    "Taking a look a various websites, we settled on using www.hikingproject.com to scrap information from hikes in the state of Coloraod. Currently the site lists 5,855 trails that are curated by staff or users. Other sites like www.alltrails.com look like they would be good sites but have web scrapping blocks in place to make it very difficult to extract information."

    "- Does the ratings/difficulty stated by the reviewers match that of the currated trail?\n",
    "- Is there other information about the trail that might give us a better idea as what the trail should be rated?\n",
    "- Is there information that might corroborate the trails difficulty/rating either by the currator or the reviewers?\n",

    "Answers to these questions could possibly be gleaned by scraping data from website like www.hikingproject.com, cleaned and then explored by visualizations and simple summary statistics. This project seeks out to explore some possible answers and directions to these questions."
